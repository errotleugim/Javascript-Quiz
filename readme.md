This is an attempt at an interactive javascript quiz.
It is not completely functional.
The timer starts when needed and then doesn't stop.
Did not realize until after having most of the main thing done that the timer needed to be substracted upon wrong answers, so that functionality is not even attempted.
The score is calculated but not displayed as a list item.
The formatting is incomplete, but intelligible. Borders were left there because I struggle with CSS placement of objects and they help me make sense of it all.
